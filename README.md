#### To-Do

- I'd like to get a button that swaps the page from a light color scheme to a dark one (something that adjusts the CSS styles)

- Possible padding adjustments to UpperBody that allow it to be more uniform - there is an uneven gap between the two and if I bring them closer together it might help.

- Addition of testing environment experience - Mocha, Chai, etc

## Project Notes

After multiple attempts, I'm going to try and make something really simplistic. Listing inspiration below.
